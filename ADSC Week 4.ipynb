    "The purpose of this project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decisions on selecting a great neighborhood out of the numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto. Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Supermarket, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like-minded people, etc. This project aims to create an analysis of features for people migrating to Scarborough to search for the best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for an emergency, water resources both fresh and wastewater, and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities. It will help people to get the awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country, or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",

    "The major purpose of this project is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who is shifting there. Social presence in society in terms of like-minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets, and other daily needs things nearby.\n",

    "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one on the rise.\n",

    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing, and details about a business. Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined.\n",
    "To compare the similarities of the two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in big cities. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data using the k-means clustering algorithm."

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus, and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API. After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood.\n",
